Additional Use Grant: Internal use only. See “Additional Use Grant” below.

Change License: Apache License, Version 2.0

## Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited production use.

You may make production use of the Licensed Work only as granted in the “Additional Use Grant.” Any use not covered by the Additional Use Grant requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

Effective on the Change Date, each version of the Licensed Work will be made available under the Change License. On and after the Change Date, that version is governed by the Change License, not this license.

You must include a complete copy of this license with any copy of the Licensed Work you distribute. You must preserve all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.

The Licensor provides the Licensed Work “as is,” without warranty or conditions of any kind, express or implied, including warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, in no event will the Licensor be liable for any damages arising out of or relating to the Licensed Work or this license, including direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, lost profits, or business interruption.

If you institute patent litigation against any entity alleging that the Licensed Work infringes a patent, your rights under this license terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Any translation of this license is provided for convenience only. The English version controls.

## Additional Use Grant, Internal Use Only

Subject to the terms of the Business Source License 1.1, you may use, copy, modify, and deploy the Licensed Work for your internal business purposes only.

You may not use the Licensed Work in any way that provides the Licensed Work, or any service or product derived from it, to any third party. This prohibition includes any hosting, managed service, software as a service, platform service, or consulting delivery to customers, whether single-tenant or multi-tenant, and whether paid or free.

For clarity:

1. “Internal” means use by your employees and individual contractors acting on your behalf, for your own operations, and not for the benefit of any customer or other third party.
2. Your affiliates under common control may use the Licensed Work internally if they comply with this license.
3. Any external or customer-facing use, resale, embedding, or hosting requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.
