# Contributing to VerifyWise

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VerifyWise! This document outlines the guidelines and rules for contributing to this project.

## Development Workflow Rules

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: No Direct Commits to Main Branches

**All changes MUST go through a Pull Request. Direct commits to `develop` or `main` branches are strictly prohibited.**

This rule exists to:
- Ensure code review and quality control
- Maintain a clear audit trail of changes
- Allow for discussion and feedback before changes are merged
- Prevent accidental breaking changes
- Enable CI/CD checks to run before merging

**Violations:**
- Direct commits will be reverted immediately
- Repeated violations may result in repository access restrictions

**Exceptions:**
- Emergency hotfixes (with prior approval from project maintainers)
- Automated bot commits (dependabot, etc.)

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear, descriptive messages

3. **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, concise title
   - Provide a description of what changed and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Request reviews from appropriate team members

5. **Address review feedback** if requested

6. **Wait for approval** before merging

7. **Merge** only after:
   - All CI checks pass
   - Required reviewers have approved
   - No merge conflicts exist

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

Examples:
```
Add user authentication feature
Fix password validation bug in login form
Update documentation for API endpoints
Remove deprecated migration file
```

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors:
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting review
- Respond to feedback promptly and professionally
- Update the PR based on feedback

### For Reviewers:
- Review PRs promptly
- Provide constructive feedback
- Approve only when confident in the changes
- Check for code quality, security issues, and adherence to standards

## Documentation Standards

When adding or modifying code:
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Keep documentation concise, accurate, and truthful
- Document all parameters, return values, and thrown exceptions
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Update related documentation files when needed

Documentation must be:
- **Concise**: No unnecessary verbosity
- **Right**: Technically accurate
- **Truthful**: No false claims about functionality
- **Purposeful**: Every piece serves a clear purpose

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting PR
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality
- Aim for high code coverage
