## VerifyWise Licensing FAQ

### What license does VerifyWise use?
VerifyWise uses the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1) with an Internal-Only Additional Use Grant.

### Can my company run VerifyWise internally in production?
Yes. Internal use is permitted. You can deploy, modify, and run VerifyWise for your own operations.

### Can we host VerifyWise for our customers?
Not under BSL. Any third-party hosting, whether single-tenant or multi-tenant, requires a VerifyWise Enterprise License.

### Can we sell VerifyWise as part of our products or services?
Not under BSL. That is an external use and requires the Enterprise License.

### What happens on the Change Date?
Each version automatically converts to Apache-2.0 on its Change Date. The Change Date is the earlier of twenty four months after that version’s first public release or a sooner date that BlueWave Labs may set. After conversion, that version is governed by Apache-2.0.

### Can our contractors help us run it internally?
Yes. Contractors may use it on your behalf for your internal use.

### Can our affiliates use it?
Yes. Affiliates under common control may use it internally if they follow the same terms.

### How do we get the Enterprise License?
Contact [VerifyWise](https://verifywise.ai/contact) to discuss terms and pricing. The Enterprise License grants rights for customer-facing and hosted use, both single-tenant and multi-tenant.

### Do we need to keep notices?
Yes. Preserve copyright, license, and attribution notices in any copies or forks.

### What about trademarks?
The code license does not grant trademark rights. Use the “VerifyWise” name only to describe compatibility or attribution. Do not brand your service as VerifyWise without written permission.

### Where can I find the legal texts?
See `LICENSE.md` for BSL 1.1 with the Internal-Only Additional Use Grant.
